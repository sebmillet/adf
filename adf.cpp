/*
  adf.cpp

  The 'Adf' library.

  Sends code to RF433 Mhz transmitter device.
  The code is made of 32-bit code intended for "Automatismes De France" slaters.
  Tested with: Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, Attiny 45

  Usage: see example/send.ino

  Schema: data on PIN PB3, that is:
    Arduino: 'data' of RF433 transmitter needs be plugged on PIN 'D3'.
    Attiny *5: 'data' of RF433 transmitter needs be plugged on PIN number 2.

  Note about ATTINY programming

  This code is mainly developped and tested with an Arduino.
  However it can be used on Attiny (tested only with an Attiny 45 though).
  Attiny compatibility has the following consequences on the code:
    1. No division (it takes too many cycles and can heavily distort signal
       timing). Note that it can be daunting to detect/test it: if dividing by
       1024 for example, it takes a few cycles as it executes as a register
       rotation (C' >> operator). But if dividing with a number not being a
       power of 2, the execution will take thousands of cycles.
    2. Avoid multiplications, hence the use of rf_table array, that'd make no
       sense on a code just intended for Arduino.
    3. Examination of F_CPU to scale delay duration in the code execution. This
       is dependant on the frequency at which Attiny is set when uploading code.

  With above precautions, the code is Attiny-proof.
